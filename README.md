What's up! My name's Griffin, and
- I am from Nashville, TN
- I am studying to get a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Rocky Top 🍊
- I love being productive, learning how things work, playing piano, and much more!
- My dream is to work with racecars 🏎️💨

I'm currently studying physics mechanics and Calculus 3, working as a lifeguard instructor, and wishing I knew how to use Github.
